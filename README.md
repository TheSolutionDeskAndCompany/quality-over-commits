## What is This?

**Quality Over Commits** is a GitHub discussion board dedicated to helping developers showcase meaningful contributions, improve their portfolios, and understand what truly impresses recruiters and peers. We emphasize the value of well-documented projects, thoughtful commits, and genuine growth‚Äîrather than just commit counts.
