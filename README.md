# 🟢 Quality Over Commits

Curious what truly makes a GitHub profile stand out?  
Me too. That’s why I started this project—to explore why **quality contributions and thoughtful work** matter far more than just racking up commits or green squares.

> I’m learning as I go, making mistakes, asking questions, and sharing what I find out. If you’re figuring this out too—or you’ve been there before—you’re welcome here.
