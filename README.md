## What is This?

**Quality Over Commits** is a GitHub community board dedicated to helping developers highlight meaningful contributions, improve their portfolios, and understand what truly impresses recruiters and collaborators.  
We believe quality work, thoughtful commit history, and impactful collaboration matter far more than sheer volume.  
Here, you'll find real stories, practical advice, and a space to discuss the signals that make developers stand out.

## üí° Why Quality Matters

Not all commits are equal.  
A well-written commit, a thoughtful PR review, or a documented issue can show your skills and professionalism far more than a long commit log.  
Discuss and discover what signals matter most for hiring, collaboration, and personal growth.
